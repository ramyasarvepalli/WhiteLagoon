> Open ApplicationDbContext and inherit from IdentityDbContext by installing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
> Add the following service in Program.cs
builder.Services.AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>().AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>();
> AddEntityFrameworkStores<ApplicationDbContext>() is used to add Identity related tables to database using EFCore.
> Add this line to OnModelCreating() override method in ApplicationDbContext class.
base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
This line is used to add Identity related keys to Identity tables using EFCore.
> Create a new class ApplicationUser that inherits from IdentityUser to add custom properties to the IdentityUser class.
> Specify the type of class to be added as ApplicationUser - public class ApplicationDbContext :IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>
> Add DbSet<ApplicationUser> property to ApplicationDbContext class. This is used to add custom properties to the IdentityUser class without creating new ApplicationUser table
as this is inherited from IdentityUser.
> Replace IdentityUser with ApplicationUser in AddIdentity<IdentityUser, IdentityRole>() method in Program.cs

> Inject IUnitOfWork in the controller constructor and use it to access the database, dbsets and repository methods.
> Inject UserManager to manage the user. UserManager is used to create, update, delete and find users.
> Inject SignInManager to sign in and sign out the user. That way we do not want to manage cookies and sessions manually. Directly we can use SignInManager 
helper methods.
> Inject RoleManager to manage roles. RoleManager is used to create, update, delete and find roles.
